#------Simple Operations------

#Enter a calculation directly into the "print" statement

print(2 + 2)
print( 100 -1 + 3)

#use parentheses to determinate wich operations are performed first

print(2*(3+4))


# NOTE: Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming). We'll have more about floats in the next lesson.
